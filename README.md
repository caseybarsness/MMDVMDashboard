# MMDV Dashboard
This is a dashboard for MMDVM servers running HBBridge and DMRLink.

This code is still being tested.

We have been testing this on the [PNW DMR](http://www.pnwdigital.net) network and have found some issues regarding performance of the application.

One of the next steps that will be to remove the Sqlite DB and replace it with elasticsearch.
